        "  Soundscape questionnaires are widely used to gather subjective information about people's perceptions and attitudes towards their acoustic environment. Despite the widespread adoption of ISO/TS 12913-3 guidelines for analyzing soundscape survey data, there are still several misapplications and interpretations. A recent study has proposed an innovative visualization approach for soundscape data analysis, using a probabilistic method that depicts the collective perception of a soundscape as a distribution of responses within the circumplex. To bring this method to life, a new open-source python package called Soundscapy has been developed. The main goal of this software is to enable the easy, accessible, and consistent application of analysis for soundscape data collected according to the ISO 12913 methods. This conference paper outlines the important features of Soundscapy, explains its basic functioning, lists its current capabilities, and gives recommendations for its best use. Finally, the future development of Soundscapy is proposed, including the integration of psychoacoustic analysis, predictive soundscape models, and soundscape indices for use in automated assessment and design.\n",

        "Soundscapy is a python toolbox for analysing quantitative soundscape data. Urban soundscapes are typically assessed through surveys which ask respondents how they perceive the given soundscape. Particularly when collected following the technical specification ISO 12913 Part 3 @ISO12913Part3, these surveys can constitute a rich source of data for soundscape analysis. Soundscapy aims to provide a comprehensive set of tools for analysing such data, including functions for data validation, analysis, and visualization.\n",
        "\n",
        "As proposed by Mitchell, Aletta, & Kang @Mitchell2022How, in order to describe the soundscape perception of a group or of a location, we should consider the distribution of responses. Soundscapy's approach to soundscape analysis follows this idea, providing functions for visualizing the distribution of responses to soundscape questionnaires.  \n",
        "\n",
        "To support this work, international standards like @ISO12913Part3 have been developed to provide a framework for the measurement, analysis, and reporting of soundscape perception. Soundscapy is a new open-source Python package that aligns with the requirements outlined in this standard, aiming to make advanced soundscape analysis techniques accessible to a wide audience. By basing its core functionality on ISO 12913-3, Soundscapy aims to lower the barriers to entry and enable more people to conduct high-quality soundscape research.\n",

The ISD is a large database of soundscape recordings and survey data collected according to the SSID Protocol @Mitchell2020Soundscape. The database contains over 3,000 recordings, each with a corresponding survey that includes information about the soundscape, the location, and the respondents. The ISD is freely available to researchers and can be used to study a wide range of soundscape-related topics.\n",

        "The ISD contains three primary types of data - surveys, pre-calculated psychoacoustic metrics, and binaural audio recordings. The surveys include several blocks of questions, the most important of which are the Perceptual Attribute Questions (PAQs). These form the 8 descriptors of the soundscape circumplex @Axelsson2010principal - pleasant, vibrant, eventful, chaotic, annoying, monotonous, uneventful, and calm. In addition, each survey includes other information about the soundscape and demographic characteristics (age, gender, etc.). Finally, the survey section includes identifiers of when and where the survey was conducted - the `LocationID`, `SessionID`, `latitude`, `longitude`, `start_time`, etc.\n",

This dataframe can then be easily saved to a .csv or Excel spreadsheet. Alternatively, a dictionary can be returned for further processing within Python.
