:::::::
:::::::::

::: notes
This distribution-based visualisation and analysis clearly shows three important characteristics of the soundscape perception of a group or location: 1. The distribution across both pleasantness and eventfulness, including the central tendency, the dispersion, and any skewness in the response. 2. The general shape of the soundscape within the circumplex space - in this case, Pancras Lock is mostly in the pleasant half, with a slight skew towards eventfulness. Proceedings of INTER-NOISE 2024 3. The degree of agreement about the soundscape perception among the sample. In addition to these visualisations, Soundscapy provides functions for calculating some basic statistics about the distribution of responses, such as the mean, median, and standard deviation, as well as metrics inspired by reporting from noise annoyance studies, such as the percentage of respondents who rated the soundscape as ‘pleasant’ or ‘eventful’.
